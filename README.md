# KTUeBook2PDF
Chrome extension which takes data from KTU eBook site and spits out PDF

##How to use this?
Clone this repo, go to 'chrome://extensions', enable 'Developer mode', click 'Load unpacked extension...' and select path to 'KTU eBook to PDF'.
Once this is done, visit KTU eBook that you want to download and above the embedded player there will be a new button called 'Download as PDF'. Click that and just wait :)

#####I might publish this to Chrome webstore one day, once I do so, I'll provide the link.
